# 🥑 FUTURE SEEDS UI README 🍅

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

This application allows users to store data about themselves as users, their seeds, and their garden journal entries to reflect on their gardening techniques and improve their future garden. It was developed on a React frontend application that connects with a Ruby on Rails backend application.

## Deployed Application
[View the deployed application on Heroku](https://future-seeds-ui.herokuapp.com/)

## Demo

## Installation and Setup:

## Backend Repo
[Backend API Repo](https://github.com/future-seeds/future-seeds-api)

## Wins 

- Self-teaching and successfully implementing a new technology, GraphQL.
- Getting a full scope understanding of how an application works working with the BE team.
- Working in a larger group comprised of FE and BE teams for the first time.

## Challenges

- Learning a new perspective of developing an application by collaborating and communicating with a Back End team
- Having the BE and the FE both learn the same new technology was difficult because it was hard to understand where some issues were. But a win was I feel I have a more complete understanding of GraphQL on the FE and BE and it was cool to problem solve with the BE and FE.
- Learning a new type of API required a different mindset then our regular RESTful API and challenged previous thoughts about getting data.


## Future Add-ons
- OAuth for User login 
- Sorting features on seeds (by height size, days to harvest, germination length, sun to shady, etc)
- User will be able to see upcoming weather
- User will be able to get weather alerts
- User will have a calendar of seed progressions and when they will be sprouting / ready to harvest 
- Users will be able to add a plot and its attributes
- User will be able to include expected vs actual growth for the journal 
- User will be prompted to fill out an end of month journal summary 
- Users will be able to see all other users specific plant informatio
